DiatomPhylogenies
=================

A repository for diatom phylogenetic trees

This is a web space intended to store published phylogenies of diatoms. The repository holds two general types of files:
1) methodologicaly explicit phylogenetic trees based on phenotypic or genetic data. These are trees derived from coded data via a tree building algorithm. 
2) informal hypotheses about evolutionary relationships.These are diagrams reflecting author's interpretation or beleif. They are derived from data that in most cases is not formally coded or procesed through a tree building program. 

Each tree is represented by the following:
1) newick format phylogenetic tree (can be downloaded and opened in any tree viewing software e.g. FigTree, TreeView, Mesquite, Seaview)
2) doi of the publication where this tree comes from (if available).
3) TreeBase or Dryad study ID of the publication where nexus files of the tree and data can be found (if available)
4) If 2) and/or 3) are missing, a full reference where the tree comes from is provided.
