     <h2>Diatom Phylogenies in OneZoom format</h2>

     <p>A web space to store published phylogenies of diatoms and other algae. The repository holds two general types of files:</p> 
     <p>1) methodologicaly explicit phylogenetic trees based on phenotypic or genetic data. These are trees derived from coded data via a tree building algorithm.</p>
    
     <p>2) informal hypotheses about evolutionary relationships.These are diagrams reflecting author's interpretation or beleif. They are derived from data that in most cases is not formally coded or procesed through a tree building program. There wont be many of these to start with.</p>
     <p>Each tree is represented by the following:</p>
    
     <p>1) the phylogenetic tree displayed in the wonderful <a href="http://www.onezoom.org">OneZoom Tree of Life Explorer format</a></p>
    
     <p>2) doi or link of the publication where this tree comes from (if available)</p>
     
     <p>3) TreeBase or Dryad study ID of the publication where nexus files of the tree and data can be found (if available)</p>
     
     <p>4) If 2) and/or 3) are missing, a full reference where the tree comes from is provided.</p>

     <p>Chronogram of the Thalassiosirales from Alverson (2014, <a href="http://www.psjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1666/12055">Paleobiology</a>).</p>

     <p>Chronogram of Pinnularia and outgroup taxa from Souffreau et al (2011, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1055790311003927">Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution</a>).</p>

     <p><a href="trees/OneZoomTheriot2009.html">Diatoms and eukaryotes </a></p>
     <p>Tree of diatoms and a number of closely and distantly related eukaryotes from Theriot et al. (2009, <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09670260902749159#.UtKb9fhY6Xo">European Journal of Phycology</a>).</p>
     <p>TreeBase: 10114</p>
     <p>Note: Branch lengths and node ages on this tree are meaningless. The TreeBase entry for this tree does not include branch lengths. To make the tree compatible with OneZoom, polytomies were first randomly resolved and branch lengths added by sampling from a normal distribution. This artificial "phylogram" was then smoothed to a relative time chronogram with root age 1 billion years. This is a larger tree with 1336 taxa and the diatoms are at the very tip. </p>

     <p><a href="trees/OneZoomTheriot2010.html">Diatoms and Bolidomonas </a></p>
     <p>Tree of diatoms and Bolidomonas as outgroup from Theriot et al. (2010, <a href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/botbel/plecevo/2010/00000143/00000003/art00005"> Plant Ecology and Evolution</a>).</p>
     <p>TreeBase: 10953</p>
     <p>Note: Node ages on this tree are arbitrary. The paper reported a phylogram which was smoothed to a relative time chronogram with root age 500 million years.</p>
